# Hostel-Management
For the past few years, the number of educational institutions is increasing rapidly. Thereby the number of hostels is also increasing for the accommodation of the students 
studying in this institution. And hence there is a lot of strain on the person who is running the hostel and software is not usually used in this context.
This particular project deals with the problems of managing a hostel and avoids the problems which occur when carried manually. Hence reduces the load on the person 
handling this. It deals with the following problems:

• Time consuming

• Human error

• Slow process

• Poor quality

• Data inconsistency

• The process of maintaining records of students is manual and time-consuming

• Maintaining attendance and fee status is difficult

• Checking vacancy in a hostel is a bit tedious if all the process is handwritten

• Getting a summary of all records is also not possible in a traditional record-keeping system

• The chances of occurring errors are more. So the records must be accurate, informative, and dynamically updated.

We have designed a Hostel Management System which can be used by Hostels for keeping a track of all the students present in the hostel. 
Nowadays, all the records in hostels are handwritten and maintained in registers which is not feasible in the long run. If you want to look for a record of a specific student 
you would have to spend hours looking through papers. 

We have made work tremendously easier, all you have to do is to enter the id of the student and all the details will be displayed to you within a second. 
We have accomplished this by using data structures, algorithms, and numerous input validations.

Data Structures Used:
LinkedHashSet: 

We wanted Fast searching and Insertion, also we had a large amount of data and we wished to maintain insertion order. 
So we went for LinkedHashSet which has a O(1) time complexity.


ArrayList:  
Java ArrayList class uses a dynamic array for storing the elements. It is like an array, but there is no size limit. 
We can add or remove elements anytime . Methods of arraylist are non-synchronized which implies at a time multiple threads are allowed and hence provides high performance
